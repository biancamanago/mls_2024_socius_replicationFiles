## Statistical Replication Files
Here are all of the statistical replication files for the manuscript. Currently available in Stata. <br>
Importantly, the data file from GSS was too large to upload. To start from the beginning, simply <br>
use the [1972-2018 download from GSS](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gq5xi148dkrk1zykq1pqt/GSS7218_R1.DTA?rlkey=3eyv89m40digomzrk9wb9faq0&st=5p8wlfj7&dl=0). and place it in the /Data folder in the working directory.

The mls__primary.do file provides detail about what script file created each of the figures and tables.

Please note, there are minor discrepancies in the replication findings here and the paper. These discrepancies do not affect any of the conclusions of the manuscript. They were the result of an issue with the creation of the contact variables for 1996 and missing by design data (this is an error by Bianca). We reached out to the team at Sage regarding how to move forward on 2024-09-25 and are waiting to hear back (updated - 2024-10-09).

## Naming Conventions
- mls is just the name we assigned internally to the project
- The numbering (e.g., data00) indicates the order in which files need to be run.
- Filenames that include "data" are for data management processes.
- Filenames that include "do" are for analyses.
