## Statistical Replication Files
Here are all of the statistical replication files for the manuscript. Currently available in Stata. <br>
Importantly, the data file from GSS was too large to upload. To start from the beginning, simply <br>
use the [1972-2018 download from GSS](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gq5xi148dkrk1zykq1pqt/GSS7218_R1.DTA?rlkey=3eyv89m40digomzrk9wb9faq0&st=5p8wlfj7&dl=0). and place it in the /Data folder in the working directory.

## Naming Conventions
- mls is just the name we assigned internally to the project
- The numbering (e.g., data00) indicates the order in which files need to be run.
- Filenames that include "data" are for data management processes.
- Filenames that include "do" are for analyses.
